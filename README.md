# Assisted Object Placement: SGS Exporter

This repository contains code for Shadowground Survivor's editor and enginer and in particular code added to allow exporting scenes/levels in a format that can be read by the other tools of my master thesis in computer graphics about "Assisted object placement" (2013) at the TUM.

You can read more about it on http://blog.blackhc.net/university-projects/msc-thesis-assisted-object-placement
